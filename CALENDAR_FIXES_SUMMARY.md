# Calendar Fixes - Week Start & Filter Consistency

## Issues Fixed âœ…

### 1. Week Start Day Changed from Sunday to Monday
**Problem**: The calendar was starting the week on Sunday instead of Monday.
**Solution**: Updated all `startOfWeek` function calls to use `{ weekStartsOn: 1 }` option.

**Changed locations**:
```typescript
// Initial state
const [selectedWeekStart, setSelectedWeekStart] = useState(startOfWeek(new Date(), { weekStartsOn: 1 }));

// Navigation functions
const goToToday = () => {
  setSelectedWeekStart(startOfWeek(new Date(), { weekStartsOn: 1 }));
};

const goToPreviousMonth = () => {
  const newMonth = subMonths(currentMonth, 1);
  setCurrentMonth(newMonth);
  setSelectedWeekStart(startOfWeek(newMonth, { weekStartsOn: 1 }));
};

const goToNextMonth = () => {
  const newMonth = addMonths(currentMonth, 1);
  setCurrentMonth(newMonth);
  setSelectedWeekStart(startOfWeek(newMonth, { weekStartsOn: 1 }));
};
```

### 2. Filter Consistency Across All Views
**Problem**: Horizontal and Analysis views were not respecting global filters properly. They were using `filteredData` directly instead of the locally filtered data.

**Solution**: Created a separate `locallyFilteredData` memoized variable that applies both global and local filters, and updated all views to use this consistently.

**Architecture Changes**:
```typescript
// New: Separate locally filtered data
const locallyFilteredData = useMemo(() => {
  return filteredData.filter(session => {
    // Apply local calendar-specific filters (week range, locations, status, types, date range)
    // ... filtering logic
  });
}, [filteredData, weekDays, selectedLocations, selectedStatuses, selectedTypes, startDate, endDate]);

// Updated: Calendar classes now use locally filtered data
const calendarClasses = useMemo(() => {
  const filtered = locallyFilteredData;
  // ... process calendar classes
}, [locallyFilteredData, weekDays]);
```

**Updated drilldown handlers**:
```typescript
// Grid view drilldown
const relatedSessions = locallyFilteredData.filter(s => 
  s.Class === session.Class && 
  s.Day === session.Day && 
  s.Time === session.Time && 
  s.Location === session.Location
);

// Horizontal view drilldown  
const relatedSessions = locallyFilteredData.filter(s => 
  s.Class === dayClass.session.Class && 
  s.Day === dayClass.session.Day && 
  s.Time === dayClass.session.Time && 
  s.Location === dayClass.session.Location
);
```

## Impact ðŸŽ¯

### Week Display
- âœ… **Monday-Sunday Order**: Week now properly starts from Monday and ends on Sunday
- âœ… **Consistent Navigation**: All week navigation (Today, Previous/Next Week, Month changes) respect Monday start
- âœ… **Day Headers**: Day display order is now Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday

### Filter Behavior
- âœ… **Global Filter Respect**: All three views (Grid, Horizontal, Analysis) now properly respect global filters applied in the filter panel
- âœ… **Location Filtering**: When "Supreme HQ" or any location is selected, all views show only classes for that location
- âœ… **Status Filtering**: Active/Inactive filters work consistently across all views
- âœ… **Type Filtering**: Class type filters are properly applied in all views
- âœ… **Date Range**: Custom date range filters work in all calendar views
- âœ… **Drilldown Consistency**: Modal drilldowns show properly filtered data matching the current view filters

### Performance
- âœ… **Optimized Filtering**: Single source of filtered data prevents redundant filtering operations
- âœ… **Memoized Calculations**: Format distributions and calendar classes are efficiently calculated
- âœ… **Reduced Re-renders**: Better dependency management in useMemo hooks

## Testing Verified âœ…

1. **Week Start**: Calendar displays Monday as first day of week
2. **Global Filters**: All views respect location, status, type, and date range filters
3. **View Switching**: No data inconsistency when switching between Grid, Horizontal, and Analysis views
4. **Drilldown Accuracy**: Modal details show correct filtered data
5. **Format Analysis**: Format distribution calculations use properly filtered data
6. **Navigation**: Week and month navigation maintains Monday-first ordering

The calendar component now provides a consistent, properly filtered experience across all view modes while starting the week on Monday as requested.
