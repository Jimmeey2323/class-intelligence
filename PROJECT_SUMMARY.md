## 🎯 Key Metrics Explained

### Fill Rate
```
(Total Check-ins / Total Capacity) × 100
```
Measures how well you're utilizing available class capacity.

### Cancellation Rate
```
(Total Cancellations / Total Bookings) × 100
```
Tracks percentage of bookings that result in cancellations.

### Class Average (All Classes)
```
Total Check-ins / Total Classes
```
Mean attendance across all classes, including empty ones.

### Class Average (Non-Empty Only)
```
Total Check-ins / Non-Empty Classes
```
Mean attendance excluding classes with zero check-ins.

### Consistency Score
```
100 - (Standard Deviation / Mean × 100)
```
Higher score = more consistent attendance patterns.

### Weighted Average
```
Σ(Check-ins/Capacity × Capacity) / Total Capacity × 100
```
Capacity-weighted fill rate across all classes.
